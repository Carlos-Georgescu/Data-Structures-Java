    Introduction to Tree Data Structure
-----------------------------------------------------------

Once again, tree is a hiearchical data structure

Root: the beginning/first node of the tree

All nodes can have #Children Nodes# which are linked to a parent node

Sibling: nodes that share the same parent

Leaf Node: No children

Tree is a recursive data structure

For every N nodes, there are N-1 edges

Depth: The numbder of edges from root to X

Height: Number of edges in longest path from x to leaf

    Binary Tree
-----------------------------------------------------------

Binary Tree: Every single tree with two children nodes
